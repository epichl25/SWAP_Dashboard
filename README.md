# SWAP-Dashboard

This repository introduces the SWAP Dashboard designed for the Smart Water Auditing (Final Year) Project.


## Mechanism:

The SWAP dashboard was designed to visualise user's water usage data on an easy-to-use yet interactive display using the Light and Versatile Graphics Library (LVGL). The dashboard communicates with the server via MQTT using an ESP8266 Wi-Fi module. For more information on the SWAP dashboard's Wi-Fi communication, please visit the following link: https://github.com/epichl25/SWAP-Dashboard-Wi-Fi
